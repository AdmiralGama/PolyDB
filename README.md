# Directions

1. Run POLYDB.sql to set up the tables
2. Run POLYDATA.sql to add all the data

## Format

People and relationships and stuff are all in the POLYDATA file

What tables are what is self explanatory and I put a comment ont the only thing that might not be

## Other shit

Made for PostgreSQL, probably doesn't work perfectly with other stuff but idk

No interface yet, idk if there will be one but we'll see
