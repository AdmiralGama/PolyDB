# Directions

1. Run tables.sql to set up the tables
2. Run people to add all the people
3. Run dating, fwb, friends, and adopted in any order to add their data

## Format

tables.sql defines all the tables

The rest of the files are data to fill those tables

The people table must be populated before any of the others because they all reference it, and it must be deleted last for the same reason

What tables are what is self explanatory and I put a comment on the only thing that might not be

## Other shit

Made for PostgreSQL, probably doesn't work perfectly with other stuff but idk

No interface yet, idk if there will be one but we'll see
